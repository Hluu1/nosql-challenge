# nosql-challenge
In this challenge, I was tasked with doing three parts. The first part was setting up the data so that it is ready to be cleaned and analysed. This involved me importing my dependancies, creating an instance of Mongo, making sure the data has been imported and read correctly while making the variables needed to start the data analysis. The second part involved me adding a new establishment to the database while also, updating its data types and checking if it was added and updated correctly. My attempt at these are found in the Juypter file named, "NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb".

The last part is mainly the analysis part of the assignemnt. It involved me quering the database for certain data to be displayed while also, converting these into a dataframe via pandas and consquently, dispaying the said data in tables. My attempt at this is found in the Juypter file named, "NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb".
